# Start Here — Fresh Chat Handoff

## What this app is

Paper Whisperer is a single-user academic paper library manager. Users import papers (via PubMed/DOI/manual entry), organize them with tags/projects, filter by keywords/year/study-type, search full-text, and run AI-powered study-type classification. Backend is Supabase (Postgres + Edge Functions). Frontend is React + TypeScript.

## What was completed (PRs #56–#65)

The entire **read-path performance track** is done:

1. **Server-side short search** (#56) — ILIKE RPC for queries < 3 chars
2. **Full-screen spinner fix** (#57) — no flash during filter transitions
3. **Keyword enrichment** (#58) — `raw_keywords` source-of-truth + reevaluation
4. **Server-side keyword filter** (#59) — RPC with cross-column synonym normalization
5. **Lazy loading / infinite scroll** (#60) — replaced eager-load-all with PAGE_SIZE=100
6. **Lazy loading fixes** (#61) — server-side sidebar data, stable select-all, E2E tests
7. **Query timing + sort/filter split** (#62) — sort changes don't refetch keyword/count queries
8. **search_vector removal from list** (#63) — dropped ~44% payload size
9. **Short search bug fix** (#64) — correct jsonb handling in RPC
10. **Abstract on-demand loading** (#65) — `has_abstract` boolean column, lazy abstract fetch

## Edge function logging hardening (post-PR #65)

Both edge functions (`analyze-paper` and `fetch-paper-metadata`) had a logging hardening pass. All sensitive data (auth tokens, user IDs, paper titles/content, raw API responses, full error objects) was removed from logs. Only operational markers (flow steps, retry counts, HTTP status codes, generic success/failure) remain. No behavior changes. See [migration-history.md](migration-history.md) for details.

**Remaining follow-up work outside this task:**
- PubMed API key is stored in plaintext `localStorage` — should be migrated to server-side storage (profiles table)
- Title-based import auto-selects first PubMed/Crossref match without user confirmation — needs a preview/review step
- Title-only duplicate detection is not covered by the dedup scan RPC (`get_duplicate_papers` only groups by PMID/DOI)

## What is stable — do not reopen casually

- The read-path architecture (server-side filter/sort/paginate/lazy-load)
- The keyword filter RPC and keyword options RPC
- The abstract on-demand loading pattern
- The sort/filter cache key split
- The select-all-filtered-IDs mechanism

These were thoroughly measured and verified. Changing them requires new evidence.

## What is intentionally deferred

- **Phase C DB optimization** (GIN indexes on jsonb keyword columns, RPC rewrites). Not justified at current scale (~400 papers). See [decisions-and-triggers.md](decisions-and-triggers.md).
- **Unused index cleanup** (`idx_papers_user_doi_unique` has 0 scans but is harmless).
- **Write-path optimization** (not profiled, not a user complaint).

## What to read next

1. [architecture-read-path.md](architecture-read-path.md) — how the read path works now
2. [decisions-and-triggers.md](decisions-and-triggers.md) — what was deferred and when to revisit
3. [migration-history.md](migration-history.md) — chronological change history

## Current recommendation

The app is performant at current scale. Network RTT to Supabase Mumbai (~200ms from Israel) dominates wall time, not DB execution. Focus new work on **features**, not performance, unless the paper count grows past ~2,000 or users report slowness.
